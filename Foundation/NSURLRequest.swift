    @header NSURLRequest.h

    This header file describes the constructs used to represent URL
    load requests in a manner independent of protocol and URL scheme.
    Immutable and mutable variants of this URL load request concept
    are described, named NSURLRequest and NSMutableURLRequest,
    respectively. A collection of constants is also declared to
    exercise control over URL content caching policy.

    <p>NSURLRequest and NSMutableURLRequest are designed to be
    customized to support protocol-specific requests. Protocol
    implementors who need to extend the capabilities of NSURLRequest
    and NSMutableURLRequest are encouraged to provide categories on
    these classes as appropriate to support protocol-specific data. To
    store and retrieve data, category methods can use the
    <tt>+propertyForKey:inRequest:</tt> and
    <tt>+setProperty:forKey:inRequest:</tt> class methods on
    NSURLProtocol. See the NSHTTPURLRequest on NSURLRequest and
    NSMutableHTTPURLRequest on NSMutableURLRequest for examples of
    such extensions.

    <p>The main advantage of this design is that a client of the URL
    loading library can implement request policies in a standard way
    without type checking of requests or protocol checks on URLs. Any
    protocol-specific details that have been set on a URL request will
    be used if they apply to the particular URL being loaded, and will
    be ignored if they do not apply.

    @enum NSURLRequestCachePolicy

    @discussion The NSURLRequestCachePolicy enum defines constants that
    can be used to specify the type of interactions that take place with
    the caching system when the URL loading system processes a request.
    Specifically, these constants cover interactions that have to do
    with whether already-existing cache data is returned to satisfy a
    URL load request.

    @constant NSURLRequestUseProtocolCachePolicy Specifies that the
    caching logic defined in the protocol implementation, if any, is
    used for a particular URL load request. This is the default policy
    for URL load requests.

    @constant NSURLRequestReloadIgnoringLocalCacheData Specifies that the
    data for the URL load should be loaded from the origin source. No
    existing local cache data, regardless of its freshness or validity,
    should be used to satisfy a URL load request.

    @constant NSURLRequestReloadIgnoringLocalAndRemoteCacheData Specifies that
    not only should the local cache data be ignored, but that proxies and
    other intermediates should be instructed to disregard their caches
    so far as the protocol allows.  Unimplemented.

    @constant NSURLRequestReloadIgnoringCacheData Older name for
    NSURLRequestReloadIgnoringLocalCacheData.

    @constant NSURLRequestReturnCacheDataElseLoad Specifies that the
    existing cache data should be used to satisfy a URL load request,
    regardless of its age or expiration date. However, if there is no
    existing data in the cache corresponding to a URL load request,
    the URL is loaded from the origin source.

    @constant NSURLRequestReturnCacheDataDontLoad Specifies that the
    existing cache data should be used to satisfy a URL load request,
    regardless of its age or expiration date. However, if there is no
    existing data in the cache corresponding to a URL load request, no
    attempt is made to load the URL from the origin source, and the
    load is considered to have failed. This constant specifies a
    behavior that is similar to an "offline" mode.

    @constant NSURLRequestReloadRevalidatingCacheData Specifies that
    the existing cache data may be used provided the origin source
    confirms its validity, otherwise the URL is loaded from the
    origin source.  Unimplemented.

 @enum NSURLRequestNetworkServiceType
 
 @discussion The NSURLRequestNetworkServiceType enum defines constants that
 can be used to specify the service type to associate with this request.  The
 service type is used to provide the networking layers a hint of the purpose 
 of the request.
 
 @constant NSURLNetworkServiceTypeDefault Is the default value for an NSURLRequest
 when created.  This value should be left unchanged for the vast majority of requests.
 
 @constant NSURLNetworkServiceTypeVoIP Specifies that the request is for voice over IP
 control traffic.
 
 @constant NSURLNetworkServiceTypeVideo Specifies that the request is for video
 traffic.

 @constant NSURLNetworkServiceTypeBackground Specifies that the request is for background
 traffic (such as a file download).

 @constant NSURLNetworkServiceTypeVoice Specifies that the request is for voice data.

    @class NSURLRequest
    
    @abstract An NSURLRequest object represents a URL load request in a
    manner independent of protocol and URL scheme.
    
    @discussion NSURLRequest encapsulates two basic data elements about
    a URL load request:
    <ul>
    <li>The URL to load.
    <li>The policy to use when consulting the URL content cache made
    available by the implementation.
    </ul>
    In addition, NSURLRequest is designed to be extended to support
    protocol-specific data by adding categories to access a property
    object provided in an interface targeted at protocol implementors.
    <ul>
    <li>Protocol implementors should direct their attention to the
    NSURLRequestExtensibility category on NSURLRequest for more
    information on how to provide extensions on NSURLRequest to
    support protocol-specific request information.
    <li>Clients of this API who wish to create NSURLRequest objects to
    load URL content should consult the protocol-specific NSURLRequest
    categories that are available. The NSHTTPURLRequest category on
    NSURLRequest is an example.
    </ul>
    <p>
    Objects of this class are used to create NSURLConnection instances,
    which can are used to perform the load of a URL, or as input to the
    NSURLConnection class method which performs synchronous loads.
